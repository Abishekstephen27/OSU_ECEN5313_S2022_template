# Xschem Tutorials and Examples


## Running Xschem
The first step when brining up any new terminal is to run:

```
fossi-tools
```

Make sure to run this command for ANY new terminal you open. 
This will set up the paths to access all the relevant tools.

Then, to bring up the LDO example in xschem, run:

```
xschem LDO.sch
```

To run Ngspice simulations, remember to have the MODELS code block in
your top level design.

The schematic Analyses_Template.sch has examples of different analyses
that you can run. *Remember* that ctrl C + ctrl V works between different
Xschem windows, so you can copy and paste the whole code block between
two different schematics.
